# Simple-VBScript-Obfuscator
A simple vbscript obfuscator originally coded by myself and I posted it from my first github account [TheR10tz](https://github.com/TheR10tz).
However, I can't access the account due to forgotten / missing password and I re-created here to give an update from my old repository.


# What is VBScript?

VBScript is an Active Scripting language developed by Microsoft that is modeled on Visual Basic. It allows Microsoft Windows system administrators to generate powerful tools for managing computers with error handling, subroutines, and other advanced programming constructs.


The dangers of VBScript is that they can be used for malicious purposes and gain access to the computer, steals information, and downloads other malware.


These scripts on the other hand are run from your computer and can cause irreversible damage to the host machine, but .vbs are not always dangerous.


# What is the purpose of obfuscation?

The purpose of obfuscation is that they can be difficult to understand, hence, it can be useful to protect the original source from preying eyes.

Obfuscated scripts can be difficult to detect from other antivirus software and can bypass security to gain access and put your machine at risk to hacking, ransomware infections..




This tool is intended for educational / entertainment purposes, thus, you can obfuscate your vbscript code by using this online tool for free.


The author is NOT responsible for any kind of damages or malicious activities you've done by using this tool.
